# sysinfo_rest_api
A tool for me to practice REST API design with Node.JS and Express, as well as setting up a means for me to access information about my remote servers quickly.

Currently:

- Runs on Node.JS
- Supports a disk space command at endpoint /disk_space
- Logs requests with current time in ISO format, IP address of the requesting machine, and the endpoint accessed
